# Mordak-Conquest
This game was created as my final project for my Intro to Programming in Java class at Clemson University. Try your best to navigate through the perilous journey without dying. You will travel and fight against 4 bosses from across the multiverse. The citizens of Mordak need you, you must save them or the world of Mordak will meet a dark end.
